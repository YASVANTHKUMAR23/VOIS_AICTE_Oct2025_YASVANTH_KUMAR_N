VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_YASVANTH_KUMAR_N

📖 Project Overview

This project is part of the VOIS–AICTE Internship (Oct 2025). It focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of Airbnb booking data. The dataset contains ~74,000 records with 29 features covering property details, room types, amenities, prices, reviews, and locations.

The main goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights in pricing, neighborhood demand, property preferences, and guest behavior.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Explore univariate and bivariate distributions.

Analyze pricing, room types, and review trends.

Visualize patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Present findings through Jupyter Notebook & PPT.

👥 End Users
